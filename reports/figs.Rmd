```{r sep, fig.cap = "The vast majority of patients survived more than 90 days after THA, and therefore the blue bars dominate the histogram (upper panel; note the scales). A normalized density plot however reveals that patients who died within 90 days were, on average, estimated to have a higher probability to do so (lower panel). There were very few observations with covariate patterns resulting in death probabilities higher than 5 % (green line). Estimated probabilities above this limit are therefore subject to extrapolation."}

```{r calibration, fig.cap = "This figure illustrates calibration between observed proportions and predicted probabilities with 95 % confidence intervals. Deviations above the diagonal line indicated that the model under-estimated the probability of death within 90 days. Such deviation was statistically significant for the external validation for predictions below 1.5 %. In contrast, with higher predicted probabilities, the model over-estimated the observed proportions of deaths."}
